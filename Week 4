The article I chose to report on this week is related to IoT trying to diminish a growing problem we are facing - food waste. 
Part of green house gas emmission stems from wasted food products that end up in landfills, however new technologies with IoT 
have been created to reduce the waste. Technologies such as sensors and predicitive articifical intelligence can determine root cause 
of food waste. Temperature monitors held inside packages can also monitor when food should be delivered or soon to expire, which 
can help target where delivery of certain foods can go, in order to be quickly bought from groceries, instead of thrown out on arrival.
