 Return all salaries that are between 40000 and 60000

select * from salaries where salary >= 40000 and <= 60000

 Select all employees hired after 01-01-1995

Select * from employees where hire_date >= 1995-01-01 

 Select all the valid titles names (with to_date = 01-01-9999). Add an extra column
written “valid” for the ones with to_date = 01-01-9999, and “not valid” for the ones with
different to_date values

 Select all titles where title is equal to engineer

Select * from titles where title = 'engineer'

 Return the minimum salary of the salary table

Select Min(Salary) from Salaries 

 What is the difference between “Having” and “Where” clauses

The "Having" clause returns values for aggregate functions, the "Where" clause returns values that match the criteria 

 Return the maximum value for date of birth on the employee table

Cannot return MAX value for column with value DateTime

 What is wrong with the following query, re-write it making the needed corrections.
 SELECT employee.emp_no, AVG(salaries.salary)
There is no join command for the tables Employees and Salaries 
-> Inner join salary.salaries on employee.emp_no 
 FROM employee INNER JOIN salaries AT employee.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
 HAVING AVG(salaries.salary) > 10000
 GROUP BY employee.emp_no

What is the difference between a relational data model and a data warehouse?
Data Warehouses store many years of data (5-10) that stores analytical data.  
A RDMS hold rows and columns stored in tables which can be queried faster for transactional data. 

 Can you tell when to use a data warehouse rather than a normalized database?
When large amounts of unstructured data is involved that is to be stored for many years, a Data Warehouse is more feasible.

 Which are the data warehouse phases?
Operational databases use ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) into the Data warehouse, where it then uses an OLAP server to 
provide analytical reports/functions to front end users. 

 Can you list the importance of the staging phase?
The staging phases consits of ETL and Data staging that handles the incoming raw data from external and internal sources that 
are held within the Operational Databases. Without proper Data Staging, the Data Warehouse would not properly store and retrieve 
information, as there could be data integrity failures. 

Multidimensional OLAP Table: 

Fact - Reports 
      PK- Revenue_ID 
      PK - Sales_ID 
      PK- Employee_ID 
      PK - Product_ID

The article I chose to report on this week is related to IoT trying to diminish a growing problem we are facing - food waste. 
Part of green house gas emmission stems from wasted food products that end up in landfills, however new technologies with IoT 
have been created to reduce the waste. Technologies such as sensors and predicitive articifical intelligence can determine root cause 
of food waste. Temperature monitors held inside packages can also monitor when food should be delivered or soon to expire, which 
can help target where delivery of certain foods can go, in order to be quickly bought from groceries, instead of thrown out on arrival.
