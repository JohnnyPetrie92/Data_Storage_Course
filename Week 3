What I have Learned after Several AI Projetcs - Alexandre Gonfalonieri 

The article I chose to read what in relation to the buzz going around about AI and how companies are still learning the fundamentals 
of AI. Deciding to start a company, product, or tool with AI is a very important step and decision making process, and this article 
puts the idea in simple terms. The way to start with AI is always ask yourself what goal you are trying to solve, and how the data will be 
collected and used. The author always strongly suggests that people should always be in focus of the AI project, as they are an invaluable 
resource. Small AI projects that involve employees will be forced to provide honest feedback which will inturn help the company deliver 
positive AI results. 

The next section of the article which was very interesting was the 3 suggestions as to how AI projects should start. The author suggests 
using AI-SaaS services (IBM Watson, Google Cloud Vision) which offer API's to help start a AI project. The next suggestion would be 
to partner with 3rd party AI companies that could help smaller companies achieve their goals for vertical integration. Lastly, another 
suggestion would be to create your own AI machine learning process from scratch. Difficult but worthwhile for companies that are multi-
national and are dependant on AI to increase their revenue. 

A very interesting article that was easy to read and understand, and could be easily shared with top exectuive working with AI, or 
those individuals that are looking for a start.
